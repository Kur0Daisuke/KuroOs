# What is this?
This is a site build to run like an operating system but not fully functional as it will be compared to the real ``* OS *``

# What features will this have?
this will have features such as
- file creation
- deleting files
- terminal system (with some used commands)
- App system
- could be able write html, css, js (can change my mind)

> Again, Idk if i could actually make these

> [!NOTE]
> most concepts and designs belong to original os

# If you're Interested
You can use or write your own code and create your own version of the os
- documentation will be on [here](https://github.com/Kur0Daisuke/KuroOs/blob/main/Documentation.md)
